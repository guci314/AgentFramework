# Task ID: 2
# Title: AI-Driven State Updater Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop an AI-driven state updater that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically rich state descriptions. This task includes creating specialized prompt templates, implementing intelligent state analysis with fallback mechanisms, and integrating these updates into the workflow step execution process.
# Details:
Implement an AI-powered module responsible for updating the workflow state. Key components include:
1.  **LLM Integration for State Description Generation**:
    *   Select and integrate a suitable LLM (e.g., via API) for generating state descriptions.
    *   Develop functions to invoke the LLM with necessary context, such as current step details, previous state, and execution outputs.
2.  **Prompt Template Engineering**:
    *   Design and implement robust prompt templates tailored to guide the LLM in producing accurate, context-aware state descriptions.
    *   Ensure templates can dynamically incorporate variables like step information, prior state, and error messages.
    *   Consider creating multiple templates for different scenarios (e.g., successful step completion, error handling, complex state transitions).
3.  **Intelligent State Analysis**:
    *   Implement logic to parse and interpret the LLM's output.
    *   Extract key information from the LLM response and structure it according to the `WorkflowState`'s global state format (defined in Task 1).
    *   Optionally, incorporate sentiment analysis or intent recognition if beneficial for state representation.
4.  **Fallback Mechanism**:
    *   Design and implement a reliable fallback strategy for situations where the LLM fails, times out, or returns unsatisfactory/unparseable responses.
    *   Fallback options could include using predefined default state updates, employing simpler rule-based logic, or notifying a human operator.
5.  **Integration with Step Execution Flow**:
    *   Modify the workflow execution engine to trigger the AI state updater after each step execution.
    *   Ensure the new state, whether generated by the AI or a fallback, is correctly persisted using the `WorkflowState` class methods (established in Task 1).
    *   Implement error handling for the state update process itself.

# Test Strategy:
1.  **LLM Integration Tests**:
    *   Verify successful API calls and responses from the chosen LLM service.
    *   Test with diverse inputs to confirm the LLM receives the correct contextual information.
    *   Mock LLM responses to test parsing logic independently.
2.  **Prompt Template Validation**:
    *   Unit test the prompt generation logic with various input data to ensure correct template population.
    *   Qualitatively evaluate the LLM-generated state descriptions for clarity, accuracy, and relevance based on different prompt templates and input scenarios.
    *   Iteratively refine prompt templates based on evaluation results.
3.  **State Analysis Logic Tests**:
    *   Test the parsing and structuring of LLM responses (both valid and malformed) to ensure robustness.
    *   Verify that the extracted state information accurately conforms to the expected format and data types for the global state.
4.  **Fallback Mechanism Verification**:
    *   Simulate LLM failures (e.g., API errors, timeouts, empty/invalid responses) to confirm the fallback mechanism is correctly triggered.
    *   Verify that the fallback mechanism produces a valid, sensible, and correctly formatted state update.
5.  **End-to-End Integration Tests**:
    *   Test the entire sequence: workflow step execution -> AI state updater invocation -> state analysis -> state storage via `WorkflowState`.
    *   Verify that the `WorkflowState` (global state and history) is updated correctly with AI-generated states (and fallback states when triggered).
    *   Execute a series of workflow steps to ensure state consistency and accurate history tracking over time.

# Subtasks:
## 1. LLM Service Integration and Invocation Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Select a suitable Large Language Model (LLM), integrate its API, and develop core functions to invoke the LLM with dynamic contextual information for state description generation.
### Details:
This subtask involves researching and selecting an LLM provider/model (e.g., OpenAI GPT series, Anthropic Claude, or a self-hosted model). Implement the necessary API client setup, authentication mechanisms, and create robust wrapper functions. These functions will be responsible for sending requests to the LLM, incorporating context such as current step details, previous workflow state, and step execution outputs. Error handling for API calls (e.g., network issues, rate limits) should be included.

## 2. Dynamic Prompt Template Engineering and Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Design and implement a system for creating, managing, and utilizing dynamic prompt templates tailored to guide the LLM in producing accurate and context-aware state descriptions for diverse workflow scenarios.
### Details:
Develop a flexible prompt templating engine. This system should allow for the creation of multiple prompt templates, each designed for specific situations (e.g., successful step completion, error handling, complex state transitions, summarization of outputs). Templates must support dynamic injection of variables such as step name, step input/output, previous state description, error messages, and desired output structure. Consider versioning or a clear organization for templates.

## 3. Intelligent LLM Response Parsing and State Structuring [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Implement logic to parse and interpret the LLM's generated state description, extract key information, and structure it according to the `WorkflowState`'s global state format (as defined in Task 1).
### Details:
Develop parsing mechanisms to process the raw text or structured output (if the LLM supports it) from the LLM. This includes extracting relevant entities, values, and semantic meaning. The parsed information must be transformed and mapped into the predefined `WorkflowState` object structure. Optionally, investigate and incorporate sentiment analysis or intent recognition from the LLM response if it adds value to the state representation (e.g., identifying if a step failed 'critically' vs. 'with a warning').

## 4. Robust Fallback Mechanism for State Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Design and implement a reliable fallback strategy to ensure state updates can still occur when the LLM fails, times out, or returns unsatisfactory/unparseable responses.
### Details:
Create a multi-tiered fallback system. This could include: 1. Retrying the LLM call with a simpler prompt or different parameters. 2. Using predefined, template-based default state updates based on step success/failure status and basic output. 3. Employing simpler rule-based logic to construct a minimal state description. 4. Logging the failure and notifying a human operator or an error queue. The fallback must always produce a valid `WorkflowState` object.

## 5. Integration of AI State Updater into Workflow Execution [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Modify the workflow execution engine to seamlessly trigger the AI-driven state updater after each step, correctly persist the new state (from AI or fallback), and handle any errors arising from the state update process itself.
### Details:
Adapt the core workflow execution loop to invoke the AI state updater module after each step's execution. This involves passing the necessary context (step result, previous state, etc.) to the updater. Ensure the new state object, whether generated by the LLM or a fallback mechanism, is correctly passed to and persisted by the `WorkflowState` class methods (as established in Task 1). Implement comprehensive error handling for the state update process to prevent workflow disruption, including logging and potential retry or escalation logic for critical update failures.
