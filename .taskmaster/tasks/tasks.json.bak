Test Case Design (for each targeted method):**_\n*   **Normal Flow (Happy Path):** Test with valid inputs and expected conditions, ensuring the method produces the correct output or state change.\n*   **Exceptional Flow (Error Handling):** Test how the method handles invalid inputs, failures from dependencies (e.g., LLM errors, sub-agent failures), or internal errors. Verify that appropriate exceptions are raised or errors are handled gracefully as per design.\n*   **Boundary Conditions:** Test with edge cases, such as:\n    *   Empty inputs (e.g., an empty plan for `execute_multi_step`, empty task description for `plan_execution`).\n    *   Single-element inputs (e.g., a plan with a single step).\n    *   Inputs at the limits of acceptable ranges.\n\n_**4. Mocking Strategy:**_\n*   Identify all external dependencies of `MultiStepAgent_v2`. These typically include:\n    *   Large Language Model (LLM) clients.\n    *   Other Agent classes or services it interacts with.\n    *   Utility classes or functions that are not part of the unit under test.\n*   Utilize `unittest.mock.patch` from Python's standard library or `pytest-mock`'s `mocker` fixture to effectively mock these dependencies.\n*   Mocks should be configured to simulate various responses: successful outcomes, error conditions, specific data returns, etc., to test different code paths within `MultiStepAgent_v2`.\n\n_**5. Specific Test Scenarios (Illustrative Examples):**_\n*   **`plan_execution`:**\n    *   Given a task description, does it correctly call the LLM and parse its response to form a structured plan?\n    *   How does it handle LLM unavailability or malformed responses from the LLM?\n*   **`execute_multi_step`:**\n    *   Test with a linear sequence of steps. Verify each step is executed in order.\n    *   Test with a plan involving steps with dependencies. Verify steps are executed only after their dependencies are met.\n    *   Simulate a step failure. How does the agent react (e.g., halt, retry, log error)?\n    *   If it delegates to sub-agents, mock these sub-agents and verify the interaction.\n*   **`register_agent`:**\n    *   Test successful registration of a compatible agent.\n    *   Test attempting to register an incompatible or duplicate agent.\n*   **`select_next_executable_step`:**\n    *   Given a plan and a set of completed steps, does it correctly identify the next step(s) that can be executed?\n    *   What happens if no steps are currently executable? Or if the plan is fully complete?\n\n_**6. Assertions and Verification:**_\n*   Use pytest's `assert` keyword for all verifications.\n*   Verify method return values against expected outcomes.\n*   Verify any changes to the agent's observable state (if applicable).\n*   Verify that mocked dependencies were called with the correct arguments, the expected number of times.\n*   Use `pytest.raises` to assert that specific exceptions are raised under error conditions.\n\n_**7. Test Organization and Readability:**_\n*   Use clear, descriptive names for test functions (e.g., `test_execute_multi_step_handles_empty_plan`).\n*   Group related tests using classes if it improves organization.\n*   Employ pytest fixtures to set up common test data, agent instances, or mock objects, reducing boilerplate and improving test readability.\n\n_**8. Test Execution and Reporting:**_\n*   Ensure all tests can be discovered and run using the `pytest` command from the project root.\n*   Configure `pytest-cov` to generate a code coverage report (e.g., in HTML format). The target is to achieve high coverage for the `MultiStepAgent_v2` class logic.",
      "testStrategy": "1.  **Automated Test Execution:** All unit tests must pass when executed via the `pytest` command in the designated test environment. The test suite should run without errors and report all results clearly.\n2.  **Code Coverage Analysis:** Generate a code coverage report using `pytest-cov`. Review this report to ensure that a significant percentage (e.g., >85%) of the `MultiStepAgent_v2` class's codebase is exercised by the tests. Identify and address any critical untested code paths.\n3.  **Method Coverage Verification:** Confirm that dedicated tests exist for all specified key methods (`execute_multi_step`, `plan_execution`, `register_agent`, `select_next_executable_step`, etc.) and other public methods of `MultiStepAgent_v2`.\n4.  **Scenario Coverage Verification:** Ensure that test cases for each method cover:\n    *   **Normal Operation:** Successful execution with typical, valid inputs.\n    *   **Error Handling:** Correct behavior (e.g., raising specific exceptions, logging errors, graceful failure) when presented with invalid inputs, simulated dependency failures, or internal errors.\n    *   **Boundary Conditions:** Behavior at the edges of valid input ranges or with special case inputs (e.g., empty lists, null values where permissible, single-item collections).\n5.  **Mocking Integrity:** Review the use of mocks to ensure that they accurately simulate the behavior of external dependencies and that tests correctly assert interactions with these mocks (e.g., methods called, arguments passed).\n6.  **Test Report Generation:** Verify that test execution can produce a structured test report (e.g., JUnit XML for CI, or HTML for local review) and a coverage report.\n7.  **Code Review:** The implemented test code will be subject to a peer review, focusing on correctness, clarity, maintainability, and the thoroughness of test scenarios.",
