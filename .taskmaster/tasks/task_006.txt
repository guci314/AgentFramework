    *   Optimization Strategies:
        *   Best practices for crafting effective and efficient prompts tailored to various workflow contexts and desired state detail.
        *   Tips for optimizing LLM API calls (e.g., considerations for token usage, response time, potential for batching if applicable).
        *   Guidance on memory optimization for state storage, particularly if user-configurable options arise from Task 5.
        *   Performance tuning advice for the AI update process, including managing concurrency and resource utilization.

4.  **User-Facing Documentation:**

    *   Best Practices:
        *   Recommendations for designing workflows that effectively leverage global state for enhanced context and decision-making.
        *   Tips for managing the complexity and granularity of global state.
        *   Guidelines for interpreting and acting upon AI-generated state descriptions, including handling potential ambiguities.
    *   Troubleshooting Guide:
        *   Compilation of common problems, frequently encountered error messages, and their step-by-step resolutions.
        *   Debugging tips for issues related to state management, state history, or AI update failures.
        *   Guidance on how to interpret monitoring data and performance statistics (from Task 5) for diagnosing and resolving issues.

6.  **Release Preparation:**
    *   Compile a comprehensive draft of release notes for the new global state and AI updater features, highlighting key functionalities, improvements, any breaking changes, and known limitations.
    *   Ensure all documentation is organized logically, version-controlled, and prepared for publishing through appropriate channels (e.g., internal knowledge base, public documentation website, API portals).

# Test Strategy:
1.  **Accuracy and Technical Review:**
    *   Subject Matter Experts (developers and architects involved in Tasks 1, 2, 3, and 5) will rigorously review all technical sections, API documentation, and configuration guides for correctness, completeness, and technical precision against the implemented features.
    *   Verify that all documented API signatures, parameters, return types, and exceptions match the codebase.
    *   Confirm that all described configuration options and their effects are accurately documented based on Task 5 outputs.

2.  **Clarity, Usability, and Target Audience Validation:**
    *   Peer Review: Conduct reviews by team members not directly involved in the feature development to assess clarity, readability, and ease of understanding for the intended audience (e.g., other developers for technical docs, workflow designers for user guides).
    *   Practical Walkthroughs: Testers or designated users will execute all steps in Quick Start Guides, tutorials, and examples to ensure they are correct, easy to follow, and achieve the described outcomes on a clean environment.
    *   Verify that user-facing language is clear, concise, and avoids unnecessary jargon.

3.  **Completeness Audit:**
    *   Cross-reference the entire documentation set against the initial requirements outlined in "第六阶段：文档编写和发布准备" to ensure all specified document types (technical docs, API reference, config/opt guides, user intro, quick start, best practices, troubleshooting) and topics are comprehensively covered.
    *   Ensure all public APIs, significant configuration parameters, and user-facing aspects of the global state and AI updater features are documented.

4.  **Consistency, Formatting, and Accessibility:**
    *   Check for consistent terminology, writing style, tone, and formatting (e.g., code blocks, headings, tables) across all documents.
    *   Ensure documentation adheres to any pre-existing organizational documentation standards, templates, or style guides.
    *   Validate all internal and external links within the documentation for correctness and accessibility.
    *   Review for basic accessibility considerations (e.g., alternative text for images if any, logical structure).

5.  **Troubleshooting Guide Efficacy:**
    *   Attempt to reproduce common issues described in the troubleshooting guide to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed solutions.
    *   Ensure that troubleshooting steps are clear, actionable, and lead to problem resolution.
    *   Verify that references to monitoring tools or logs (from Task 5) are accurate and helpful for diagnosis.
