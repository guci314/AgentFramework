        "details": "Implement a configuration module using Pydantic's `BaseSettings`. Create a `Settings` class that loads variables from a `.env` file and the environment. This will provide typed, validated configuration for components like `LLM_PROVIDER`, `API_KEY`, `DEFAULT_TOKEN_LIMIT`, etc. This is a foundational step for all other components that require external configuration.",

        "details": "Design a generic `LLMClient` interface with methods like `generate(prompt, stream=False)` and `count_tokens(text)`. Implement concrete classes for each supported provider (e.g., `OpenAIClient`, `GeminiClient`) that adapt their respective SDKs (e.g., `openai` > 1.0, `google-generativeai`, `anthropic`) to this interface. Use a factory pattern to instantiate the correct client based on the global configuration.",

Implement the four layers as distinct methods or classes. `SuperEgo` performs meta-cognitive checks. `Ego` handles rational planning and instruction generation. `Id` evaluates progress against the core goal. `Body` uses the `StatefulExecutor` to act.

        "details": "Implement an `execute_stream` method on the `CognitiveAgent`. This method will call the LLM's streaming API within each cognitive layer (Ego, Id, etc.) and yield the formatted natural language output from each layer as it's generated.
