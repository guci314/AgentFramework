# AgentFrameWork - Advanced AI Agent Framework PRD

## Overview

AgentFrameWork is an advanced, multi-functional AI Agent framework designed to build, manage, and coordinate intelligent agents capable of autonomously executing complex multi-step tasks. The framework represents a paradigm shift from traditional static agent workflows to dynamic, adaptive cognitive workflow systems with natural language state management.

The framework solves the problem of rigid, hard-coded agent workflows by providing dynamic navigation, cognitive architecture, and natural language-first design principles. It's designed for developers building sophisticated AI agent systems that need to handle complex, multi-step tasks with adaptive execution patterns.
