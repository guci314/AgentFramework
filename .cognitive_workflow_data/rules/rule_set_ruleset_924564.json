Create a calculator program in `calculator.py` that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division\n2. Create comprehensive unit tests for the calculator in `test_calculator.py` \n3. Run the tests to ensure everything works correctly\n4. The coder should handle the implementation and the tester should handle the testing\n\nThis is a complete software development task that requires both coding and testing expertise.",
