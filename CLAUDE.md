## Project Overview

AgentFrameWork is an advanced, multi-functional AI Agent framework designed to build, manage, and coordinate intelligent agents capable of autonomously executing complex multi-step tasks. The framework has evolved significantly from static workflows to dynamic, adaptive task execution, representing a paradigm shift from traditional agent frameworks to cognitive workflow systems.

### Project Evolution
The framework has undergone significant architectural evolution:

1. **Early Stage (`enhancedAgent_v2.py`)**: Established foundational concepts including multi-agent collaboration, state management, prompt templates, and response parsers, but with relatively fixed workflows.

2. **Mid-Stage (`MultiStepAgent_v3.py`)**: Iterative optimization of early versions with improved core logic but still with limitations.

3. **Current State**: Three major advanced systems:
   - **CognitiveWorkflow**: Revolutionary dynamic navigation with planner-decider-executor roles
   - **TaskMasterAgent**: Integration with external "Task Master AI" for intelligent task decomposition
   - **EmbodiedCognitiveWorkflow**: Four-layer cognitive architecture with natural language state management

## Core Architecture

### üß† Foundational Design Principle: Natural Language First

**The entire framework is built on a fundamental principle: ALL communication and state management uses natural language.**

- **Instructions are Natural Language**: User commands, task descriptions, and agent communications are all in natural language
- **States are Natural Language**: All cognitive states, evaluations, and context information are stored and transmitted as natural language descriptions
- **No Hard-coded Enums**: The system avoids rigid state enumerations, instead using flexible natural language descriptions
- **Human-Readable Transparency**: Every aspect of the cognitive process can be understood and audited by humans
- **AI-Model Friendly**: Natural language states are inherently compatible with Large Language Models

This design enables:
- **Cognitive Transparency**: All agent thinking processes are human-readable
- **Dynamic Flexibility**: States can evolve and adapt without code changes
- **Cross-Agent Communication**: Different agent types can understand each other's states
- **Debugging Simplicity**: All states and decisions are in plain language
- **Extensibility**: New cognitive patterns can be added without structural changes

### Current Advanced Systems

#### 1. CognitiveWorkflow System (`CognitiveWorkflow/`)
The most advanced implementation featuring dynamic navigation and adaptive execution:

- **CognitivePlanner**: Divergent thinking, generates comprehensive task lists with all possibilities
- **CognitiveDecider**: Runtime dynamic orchestration, state satisfaction checking, plan modification
- **CognitiveExecutor**: Pure execution unit focused on task completion
- **Key Innovation**: Replaces static dependencies with natural language preconditions
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Real-time path construction instead of predefined flow charts

##### 1.1 Production Rule Workflow System (`cognitive_workflow_rule_base/`)
Advanced production rule-based cognitive workflow engine with DDD architecture:
- **Domain Driven Design**: Clean separation of concerns with domain, service, application, and infrastructure layers
- **CognitiveAgent**: Application layer wrapper providing intelligent instruction classification and multi-step execution
- **TaskTranslator**: Solves context pollution in hierarchical cognitive architectures
- **Production Rule Engine**: IF-THEN natural language rule execution with adaptive optimization
- **Context Pollution Solution**: Hierarchical cognitive architecture with task translation layer for filtering complex upper-layer context

#### 2. Embodied Cognitive Workflow System (`embodied_cognitive_workflow/`)
**The most advanced natural language cognitive architecture featuring four-layer intelligence:**

**üß† Four-Layer Cognitive Architecture:**
- **SuperEgo (Ë∂ÖÊàë)**: Meta-cognitive supervision and ethical constraints with UltraThink capabilities
- **Ego (Ëá™Êàë)**: Rational analysis and decision-making with state analysis and action planning
- **Id (Êú¨Êàë)**: Value-driven evaluation and goal monitoring with task specification management
- **Body (Ë∫´‰Ωì)**: Execution and perception layer based on existing Agent systems

**üåü Natural Language State Management:**
- **WorkflowContext**: Central context manager with natural language state representation
  - `current_state`: Natural language description of cognitive analysis by Ego
  - `id_evaluation`: Natural language evaluation results from Id
  - `goal_achieved`: Boolean control variable for workflow termination
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Real-time cognitive cycle based on natural language state analysis
- **Incremental Planning (Â¢ûÈáèÂºèËßÑÂàí)**: Step-by-step adaptive execution without predefined workflows

**üîÑ Cognitive Cycle Process:**
1. **Complexity Assessment**: Ego evaluates if task needs cognitive cycle
2. **State Analysis**: Ego analyzes current situation in natural language
3. **Decision Making**: Ego decides next action based on state analysis
4. **Value Evaluation**: Id evaluates goal achievement using natural language assessment
5. **Body Execution**: Body executes concrete actions
6. **Cycle Control**: WorkflowContext.goal_achieved determines continuation

**üí° Key Innovations:**
- **Natural Language Preconditions**: Replace static dependencies with flexible language descriptions
- **Cognitive Debugging**: CognitiveDebugger provides step-by-step execution analysis
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time cognitive process observation
- **JSON-based Evaluation**: Structured goal achievement assessment
- **Multi-modal Evaluation**: Both internal (Id) and external (Body observation) evaluation modes

## Agent Interaction Patterns

### üß† Embodied Cognitive Workflow Execution (Most Advanced - Recommended)
**Natural Language State Management with Four-Layer Cognitive Architecture**

```python
from embodied_cognitive_workflow import CognitiveAgent
import pythonTask

# Create cognitive agent with natural language state management
agent = CognitiveAgent(
    llm=pythonTask.llm_gemini_2_5_flash_google,
    max_cycles=5,                    # Maximum cognitive cycles
    verbose=True,                    # Show natural language process
    enable_super_ego=True,           # Enable meta-cognitive supervision
    evaluation_mode="external"       # Use JSON-based goal evaluation
)

# ‚ú® All instructions are natural language
instruction = "ÂºÄÂèë‰∏Ä‰∏™PythonËÆ°ÁÆóÂô®Á®ãÂ∫èÔºåÂåÖÂê´Âü∫Êú¨ÁöÑÂõõÂàôËøêÁÆóÂäüËÉΩ"

# Synchronous execution with natural language states
result = agent.execute_sync(instruction)
print(f"Result: {result.return_value}")

# Streaming execution - observe natural language cognitive process
for chunk in agent.execute_stream(instruction):
    if isinstance(chunk, Result):
        print(f"Final Result: {chunk.return_value}")
    else:
        print(f"Cognitive Process: {chunk}")  # Natural language descriptions

# Chat mode with natural language state persistence
chat_result = agent.chat_sync("Please explain the calculator architecture")
```

**üîç Natural Language Cognitive Debugging:**
```python
from embodied_cognitive_workflow.cognitive_debugger import CognitiveDebugger, StepType

# Create debugger for step-by-step natural language analysis
debugger = CognitiveDebugger(agent)
debugger.start_debug("ËÆ°ÁÆó 15 + 23 ÁöÑÁªìÊûú")

# Single-step execution with natural language state inspection
while not debugger.debug_state.is_finished:
    step_result = debugger.run_one_step()
    if step_result.step_type == StepType.ID_EVALUATION:
        # Inspect natural language evaluation
        print(f"Êú¨ÊàëËØÑ‰º∞ (Natural Language): {step_result.output_data}")
        print(f"ÁõÆÊ†áËææÊàêÁä∂ÊÄÅ: {debugger.debug_state.workflow_context.goal_achieved}")
```

**üéØ Natural Language State Access:**
```python
# Access natural language states directly
context = agent.workflow_context  # If available from execution
print("Natural Language Context:")
print(f"- Current State: {context.current_state}")      # Natural language analysis
print(f"- Id Evaluation: {context.id_evaluation}")     # Natural language evaluation  
print(f"- Goal Achieved: {context.goal_achieved}")     # Boolean control variable
print(f"- Full Context:\n{context.get_current_context()}")  # Complete natural language context
```

### CognitiveWorkflow Execution
```python
# Direct usage
from CognitiveWorkflow.cognitive_workflow import CognitiveWorkflowEngine
engine = CognitiveWorkflowEngine(llm=llm, agents=agents)
result = engine.execute_cognitive_workflow("high-level goal")

# Using adapter for compatibility
from CognitiveWorkflow.cognitive_workflow_adapter import CognitiveMultiStepAgent
agent = CognitiveMultiStepAgent(llm=llm, registered_agents=agents, use_cognitive_workflow=True)
result = agent.execute_multi_step("task description")
```

### Legacy Execution Methods
- `execute_sync(instruction)` - Synchronous code execution
- `execute_stream(instruction)` - Streaming execution with real-time output
- `chat_sync(message)` - Synchronous conversation
- `chat_stream(message)` - Streaming conversation

### Team Coordination
- **CognitiveWorkflow**: Dynamic agent selection based on task requirements and state
- **Legacy**: Agents registered via `AgentSpecification` with name, instance, and description
- State sharing through StatefulExecutor variables and GlobalState
- Memory loading via `loadKnowledge(knowledge_string)`
- Natural language preconditions for intelligent task orchestration

## Memory Management Best Practices

### Token Limits
- Default: 60,000 tokens (configurable via `AGENT_MAX_TOKENS` environment variable)
- Automatic memory reduction at 80-90% threshold
- Protected messages preserved during reduction
- CognitiveWorkflow uses intelligent memory optimization

### Memory Strategies
1. **Token-based**: Preserves recent conversation pairs and protected messages
2. **Compression**: Intelligently compresses middle conversations while preserving context
3. **Cognitive**: Dynamic memory management based on task relevance and state importance
4. **Caching**: SQLite-based LLM response caching for performance optimization

## Code Conventions
