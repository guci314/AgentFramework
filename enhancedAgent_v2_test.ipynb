This text should be captured and reviewed, not executed.\n",

      "1. **No Charts**: The report must be text-based (no visualizations).\n",
      "2. **Specific Content**: The report should include:\n",
      "   - Summary statistics\n",

      "   - Time-based analysis (if applicable)\n",

      "4. **Tool**: Use Gemini for analysis (likely referring to Google's Gemini AI or a similar tool for data processing).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggested Approach:\n",
      "1. **Data Loading**:\n",

      "   stats = sales_data.describe(include='all')\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Trend Analysis** (Example):\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   monthly_sales = sales_data.groupby('Month')['Revenue'].sum()\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Top Performers**:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   top_products = sales_data.groupby('Product')['Sales'].sum().nlargest(5)\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Save Report**:\n",
      "   ```python\n",

      "       f.write(\"# Sales Analysis Report\\n\\n\")\n",

      "    *   Reinforced: \"It must NOT be a string representation of the dictionary, nor a textual summary of the operation, nor any other data type. The calling environment will directly access `Result.return_value` expecting the raw Python dictionary.\"\n",
      "2.  **Enhanced Result Handling in Orchestrator Code**:\n",
      "    *   After checking `result_exec1.success`, it now explicitly checks if `result_exec1.return_value` is a dictionary and has the expected top-level keys, and that their values are also dictionaries.\n",
      "    *   If this validation fails, it prints a \"DATA CONTRACT VIOLATION\" message and stores an appropriate error in `global_step_outputs['exec1_error']`.\n",
      "    *   A flag `exec1_successful_with_correct_data` is used to track if the step was truly successful in terms of both agent execution and data format.\n",
      "    *   Ensures `global_step_outputs.pop('aggregated_sales_data', None)` is called if data is incorrect or an error occurs, to prevent bad data from propagating.\n",

      "    *   It emphasizes that this JSON string should be the *only* thing printed to `stdout`.\n",
      "    *   It clarifies that `Result.return_value` is now secondary.\n",
      "2.  **Orchestrator Script Logic**:\n",
      "    *   If `result_exec1.success` is true, it now primarily looks at `result_exec1.stdout`.\n",
      "    *   It attempts to `json.loads(result_exec1.stdout.strip())`.\n",
      "    *   It includes error handling for `json.JSONDecodeError`.\n",
      "    *   It validates the structure of the dictionary parsed from JSON.\n",
      "    *   The `global_step_outputs['aggregated_sales_data']` is populated from this parsed JSON.\n",
      "    *   Error messages are more specific to failures in parsing or validating stdout.\n",
